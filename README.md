# AI-The8PuzzleProblem
Solving the 8puzzle Problem with an Artificial Intelligent algorithm
using A*Search with a heuristic, first being AI1.py with the Misplaced tiles(AI1) 
and the AI2.py running using the Manhattan Distances(AI2) heurstic

Given any inital state of the puzzle the algorithm intelligently and most effectivly places the pieces in the correct position
